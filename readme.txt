Easily add a custom favicon and Apple touch icon to your WordPress site, including support for dark mode, SVG icons, and admin dashboard branding.

== Description ==

**Custom Favicon** lets you upload and manage favicons for your WordPress website, admin area, and login screen using the native media uploader. Unlike the built-in Site Icon feature, this plugin gives you full control — including support for separate frontend and backend icons, Apple touch icons, dark mode icons, and SVG format.

**Features include:**
- Upload custom favicon for frontend (browser tab icon)
- Upload separate favicon for WordPress Dashboard and login page
- Upload Apple touch icons for iOS devices
- Upload dark mode specific favicon
- SVG favicon support
- Option to disable default WordPress Site Icon output
- Clean and simple settings page under **Settings → Custom Favicon**

This plugin is useful for:
- Replacing the default WordPress favicon
- Branding the WordPress dashboard for clients
- Adding modern favicon features with minimal setup

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this override the default WordPress Site Icon? =
Yes. When enabled, the plugin replaces WordPress’s default favicon and Apple icon output.

= Can I use SVG files? =
Yes. Modern browsers support SVG favicons. If your theme doesn’t allow SVG uploads, you may need to enable that manually.

= Does this support light/dark mode favicons? =
Yes. You can upload separate favicons for light and dark appearance modes using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

= Can editors access the settings page? =
By default, only Administrators (with the `manage_options` capability) can access the settings page.
Developers can override this using the `custom_favicon_capability` filter. For example, to allow Editors:
```php
add_filter( 'custom_favicon_capability', function () {
    return 'edit_theme_options';
} );

= Where can I get help? =
